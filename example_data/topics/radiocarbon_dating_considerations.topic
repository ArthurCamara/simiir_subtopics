Radiocarbon dating considerations

The variation in the 14 C/12 C ratio in different parts of the carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of the age of a sample based on the amount of 14 C it contains will often give an incorrect result. There are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered. The errors are of four general types:

Variations in the 14 C/12 C ratio in the atmosphere, both geographically and over time
Isotopic fractionation
Variations in the 14 C/12 C ratio in different parts of the reservoir
Contamination
