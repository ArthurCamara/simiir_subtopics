radiocarbon dating considerations

The variation in the Carbon 14/Carbon 12 ratio in different parts of the carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of the age of a sample based on the amount of Carbon 14 it contains will often give an incorrect result. There are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered. The errors are of four general types:

Variations in the Carbon 14/Carbon 12 ration in the atmosphere, both geographically and over time
Isotopic fractionation
Variations in the Carbon 14 / Carbon 12 ratio in different parts of the reservoir
Contamination
